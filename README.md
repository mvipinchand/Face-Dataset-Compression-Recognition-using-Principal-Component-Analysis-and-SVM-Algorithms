# Labelled Faces in the Wild Face Dataset_PCA_Compression_SVM_Classification

Labeled Faces in the Wild, a database of face photographs compiled by the Computer Vision Laboratory of Amherst University of Massachusetts designed for studying the problem of face recognition under unrestricted conditions. 13,000 images of faces collected from the web 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. Original LFW dataset we see above, where face matching accuracy can be unrealistically boosted through the use of background parts of images (i.e. by using possible correlations between faces and backgrounds). LFWcrop Face Dataset -- cropped gray version of the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, keeping only the center portion of each image (i.e. the face) where background is omitted.<br />
